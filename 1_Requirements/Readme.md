## Introduction
The usual practices in accommodating students at  Lagos  State  University,  as  well  as  other universities,  involve  students  going  to  the Students’  Affairs  office  to  fill  out  a  form  for registration. Thereafter,  students are  registered for  the  new  session  by  providing  a  bank teller/receipt  of  payment  and  a  new  hostel accommodation  would  be  allocated  to  the student.  After  registration,  students’ profiles are transferred to  the  porter’s lodge  where  students will  receive  a  mattress,  pillow,  and  so  on. Unfortunately,  these processes  are carried  out manually  with  pen  and  papers;  an  unreliable procedure  which  is  associated  with inefficiencies.  The  process  of  hostel  registration  in  many universities  employs  a  parochial  system  that involves students going  to the Students’  Affairs Office to fill out a form for registration. This form seeks  to  find  out  details  of  the  student. Thereafter,  students  will  register  for  the  new session  by  providing  a  bank  teller  receipt  to show payment has been made and a new hostel would  be  allocated  to  the  student.  After registration,  students’  profiles  would  be transferred to  the  porter’s lodge  where  students will receive a mattress, pillow, chairs, and tables. Unfortunately,  these processes  are carried  out manually  with  pen  and  papers,  an  unreliable procedure which also wastes time.
